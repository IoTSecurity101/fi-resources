    "\n",
    "## SAD: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many powerful new features on the ChipWhisperer Husky is the ability to trigger on the detection of a particular waveform pattern. This is done via a \"SAD\" trigger, which stands for Sum of Absolute Differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we must capture a baseline power trace and identify a pattern that we wish to use as a trigger. With the waveform data specific, the ChipWhisperer will then monitor the analog input signal and look for the same pattern, when that pattern is detected, a trigger event will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, no two analog data samples are identical, so we can specify a threshold that we want the trigger module to use. \n",
    "\n",
